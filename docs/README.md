# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

A centralized, shareable entry point for how OctoAcme plans, executes, releases, and improves projects. This README helps new and existing team members quickly understand the framework, navigate deeper guides, and keep key artifacts up to date. It is a living document—improvements welcome.

## Project Management Framework Overview
OctoAcme delivers value through a lightweight, iterative, and transparent approach:
- Principles: customer-first, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, psychological safety.
- Roles: Project Manager (delivery coordination), Product Manager (outcomes & prioritization), Developers (implementation & quality), QA/Testing, Stakeholders (inputs/approvals).
- Core Artifacts: One-pager / Charter, Backlog, Release Plan, Risk Register, Definition of Done (DoD), Retrospective action log.
The framework moves work predictably through a defined lifecycle emphasizing clarity, alignment, measurable outcomes, and continuous improvement.

## Lifecycle Summary
1. Initiation — Frame the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial feasibility. Produce a One-pager.
2. Planning — Break down scope, prioritize backlog, define DoD, identify dependencies & risks, map milestones.
3. Execution & Tracking — Build in small increments, maintain rhythm (standups, syncs, demos), track progress & quality.
4. Release & Deployment — Standardized, low-risk deployment with readiness checks, rollback planning, and observability.
5. Retrospective & Improvement — Capture learnings, create accountable action items, and feed improvements back into processes.

## Key Artifacts
- Project One-pager / Charter
- Prioritized Backlog (with acceptance criteria)
- Risk Register
- Release Plan & Milestone Map
- Definition of Done (DoD)
- Retrospective Action Log / Improvement Tracker

## Using These Docs
- Start with the Overview to orient new collaborators.
- Keep the One-pager and risk register current as living documents.
- Reference planning and execution guides when refining backlog or establishing team rhythm.
- Use release and retrospective guides at their respective lifecycle gates.
- Propose updates or new process docs via the issue template: “Add Content to Project Management Process Docs.”
